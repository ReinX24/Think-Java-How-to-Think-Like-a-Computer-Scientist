         * Exercise 8.6 Many of the patterns you have seen for traversing arrays can
         * also be written recursively. It is not common, but it is a useful exercise.
         * 1. Write a method called maxInRange that takes an array of integers and
         * two indexes, lowIndex and highIndex, and finds the maximum value
         * in the array, but considering only the elements between lowIndex and
         * highIndex, including both.
         * This method should be recursive. If the length of the range is 1 (i.e., if
         * lowIndex == highIndex), we know immediately that the sole element
         * in the range must be the maximum. So thatâ€™s the base case.
         * If there is more than one element in the range, we can break the array into
         * two pieces, find the maximum in each piece, and then find the maximum
         * of the maxima.
         * 
         * 2. Methods like maxInRange can be awkward to use. To find the largest
         * element in an array, we have to provide the range for the entire array:
         * double max = maxInRange(a, 0, a.length - 1);
         * Write a method called max that takes an array and uses maxInRange to
         * find and return the largest element.
         *
